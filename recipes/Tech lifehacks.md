## Use “Focus” Modes to Automate Productivity
On phones or computers, set up custom focus modes (like Work, Sleep, Study) that automatically silence notifications, switch wallpapers, and open specific apps at certain times.
Example: During “Work” mode, block social media and only allow Slack or email alerts.

## Turn Old Devices Into Useful Tools
1. Old phone => Security camera (use apps like Alfred or Manything)

2. Old tablet => Smart home dashboard (display calendar, weather, and to-do list)

3. Old laptop => Media server (use Plex or Jellyfin)

## Speed Up Your Phone With a Simple Reboot Routine
Restart your phone every 2–3 days — it clears memory leaks, resets slow background apps, and improves performance without deleting data.

## Use a Password Manager + Passkeys Combo
Password managers (like Bitwarden or 1Password) can now store passkeys, which are faster and phishing-proof. Combine them with 2FA (authenticator app > SMS) for maximum security.

## Automate Repetitive Tasks With Shortcuts or Scripts
1. On iPhone: Use Shortcuts to send messages, resize photos, or launch playlists with one tap.
2. On PC/Mac: Use AutoHotkey or Automator to batch rename files, open daily work apps, etc.
