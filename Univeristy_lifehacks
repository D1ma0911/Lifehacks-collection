## #1 The Pomodoro Trick
Study for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break.  
It keeps your focus sharp and stops burnout before it starts.

## #2 Use Student Discounts
Your student email gives you free or cheap access to apps like:  
- Spotify Premium  
- Notion Pro  
- Canva  
- Microsoft 365  
Never pay full price again.

## #3 Record Lectures (If Allowed)
Record your lectures and use AI tools like Whisper or Notta to transcribe them.  
Youâ€™ll never miss a detail â€” even if your brain zones out halfway through.

## #4 Backup Everything
Save your notes to Google Drive or GitHub.  
A crashed laptop the night before finals is *not* a fun plot twist.

## #5 Ask Senior Students
Theyâ€™ve already survived what youâ€™re going through.  
Old exams, notes, and advice from them can save you a ton of time.
